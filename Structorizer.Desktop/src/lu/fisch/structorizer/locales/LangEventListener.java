/**
 * The listener interface for receiving Structorizer locale events. The class that is interested in
 * processing a locale event implements this interface, and the object created with that class is
 * registered with a {@link LangTextHolder} or with a {@link Locales} instance using the component's
 * addLangEventListener method.
 * When the {@link LangEvent} occurs, that object's LangChanged method is invoked.
